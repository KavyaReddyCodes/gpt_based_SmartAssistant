# gpt_based_SmartAssistant
This project develops a voice-controlled assistant powered by OpenAI's GPT model, designed to understand and respond to natural language queries. It uses speech recognition to capture audio commands, converts them to text, processes the text via the ChatGPT API, and delivers the response through text-to-speech.
